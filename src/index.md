Various things I've made.

## Obsidian plugins

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is an excellent Markdown PKM which works off local files. I transitioned to it from Evernote and haven't looked back.

One of the best things about it is that it's super easy to customise if you know a bit of Javascript. These are the plugins I've written for it:

- [Google Photos](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-google-photos) - Adds Google Photos integration
- [Image Captions](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-image-captions) - Adds captions to images
- [Folder Notes](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-folder-notes) - Adds Folder Notes to the default file tree

I also maintain unofficial portable builds of Obsidian for Windows:
